# ts-boilerplate
Simple boilerplate for building websites with typescript and sass, but without all the muck

## Overview

Author in typescript in `src/ts` and sass in `src/scss`. Run `make` to transpile. Run `make watch` to set up a watcher.

## TODO

Find a way to manage injection of CSS and JS files. For now that needs to be manually done on HTML files.
